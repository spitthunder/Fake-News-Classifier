# Fake-News-Classifier
##This is a a deep learning model, specifically that uses LSTM (Long-short term memory) to classify fake news and real news.
##This model also uses Monte Carlo Dropout layer that further increases the robustness by predicting the uncertainty level of the model's prediction regarding fake or real.
