# Fake-News-Classifier

### This is a a deep learning model, specifically that uses LSTM (Long-short term memory) to classify fake news and real news.

### This model also uses Monte Carlo Dropout layer that further increases the robustness by predicting the uncertainty level of the model's prediction regarding fake or real.

### The training dataset used is the "WELFake" dataset taken from Kaggle. The test dataset is taken from a Kaggle Competition.

### The accuracy score that we got on the training dataset is after doing Bayesian Hyperparameter optimization using Keras Tuner.
